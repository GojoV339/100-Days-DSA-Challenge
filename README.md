# 💯 100 Days of DSA (Java)

Welcome to my **100 Days of Data Structures & Algorithms** journey!  
This repository contains my **daily problem-solving practice**, focused on mastering DSA using **Java**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Build strong problem-solving skills  
- Become interview-ready for top product-based companies  
- Maintain consistent daily practice  
- Learn optimized Java approaches and patterns  

---

## 📚 Resources I'm Following

- **Striver A2Z DSA Sheet**
- **LeetCode / CodeStudio**
- **GeeksForGeeks (for theory)**
- **Mock Interviews (Pramp – later stage)**

---

## 🚀 Progress Tracking

I will upload my solutions **daily** to maintain accountability and track improvement.

- Each folder will represent a **topic or day**
- Problems will include:
  - Solution code in Java
  - A brief explanation (if needed)
- Some problems may include multiple approaches (better time/space complexity)

---

## 🔥 Expected Outcome

By the end of 100 days, I aim to:  
✔ Solve 350+ structured problems  
✔ Strengthen core logic building skills  
✔ Learn reusable patterns for problem solving  
✔ Gain confidence for coding interviews
